## ⚙️ Local Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/PharmaPal.git](https://github.com/your-username/PharmaPal.git)
cd PharmaPal
```
```
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

This isolates the project's dependencies from your system.

On Windows:
Bash

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

```
```
3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from requirements.txt.
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

(If you don't have a requirements.txt, create one with pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing Flask, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn).

4. Run the Application

Start the Flask development server.
Bash

python app.py

```
```

5. Open in Browser

Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
